Here is your task:

  You need to complete the implementations for all functions (i.e., those with pass
  statements) and pass the unit tests.

  Do not change the names of existing functions or classes, as they may be referenced
  from other code like unit tests, etc.

  When you generate code, you must maintain the original formatting of the function
  stubs (such as whitespaces), otherwise we will not able to search/replace blocks
  for code modifications, and therefore you will receive a score of 0 for your generated
  code.
